# Template Tests Directory

Each `.yaml` template file in [this tests directory](./)
	has a corresponding `.out` file giving the expected output.

Any other files are static input for one or more templates.

All examples from the [project documentation](../README.md) should show
	the file path in this directory as a comment and be kept synchronized.

- These test cases double as examples.
- Examples which are not referenced and explained elsewhere in the
	documentation should have a section in this README.
